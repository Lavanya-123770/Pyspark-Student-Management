# Pyspark-Student-Management
Student Management in PySpark: This project uses PySpark to load, analyze, and manage student data. It shows student details, filters by GPA, counts students per department, calculates average GPA, categorizes performance levels, runs SQL queries, and saves the results as CSV, JSON, and Parquet files.
